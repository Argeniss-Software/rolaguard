# RoLaGuard Community Edition

## Run RoLaGuard using docker-compose

To install docker-compose, go to [this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow the instructions for your OS. Note that for Windows and MacOS, docker-compose is included in Docker desktop. For Linux, you'd have to download both programs separately

After docker-compose is installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project and its submodules `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Argeniss-Software/rolaguard && cd rolaguard`
1. Execute `docker-compose up`. Running this command will pull the images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=rolaguard&type=image). If you prefer to build the images locally, you have to run these commands before:

    ``` bash
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/postgres:latest ./postgres
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/backend:latest ./backend
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/frontend:latest ./frontend
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/data-collectors:latest ./data-collectors
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/packet-writer:latest ./packet-writer
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/engine:latest ./engine
    docker build -t rolaguardcommunity/system-backoffice:latest ./system-backoffice
    ```

1. Once you executed `docker-compose up`, **wait until all the components init** (it may take a couple minutes) and access the RoLaGuard web interface following this link <http://localhost:30000>.

To access the system use these credentials:

* user: admin
* password: admin

> _Please, remember to change the password_

An open network server is pre-loaded, therefore, some alerts must appear.

All the data generated by the the system will be saved in ~/rolaguard, to be persisted when the system is shutdown.
The folder used to persist data can be changed modifying the field services->postgres->volumes in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Run RoLaGuard using Makefile

To start up the system locally with all the modules running inside docker containers, simply run `make all` command. This will clean up the database, pull the develop branch of all modules, and build the images. It'll take a time to finish its execution, so please be patient. Go to the [Makefile](./Makefile) to see other options.
